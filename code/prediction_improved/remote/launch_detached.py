"""Start a training job on the Colab VM without holding the exec channel open.

Colab's free tier reclaims idle-looking VMs, and three runs of this campaign were lost
because results existed only on the VM when it went away. The obvious fix, polling and
downloading each file as it appears, does not work if the job is started with a foreground
``colab exec``: that call occupies the session until the job ends, so every later exec,
including the download, queues behind it and cannot run until it is too late.

This starts the job detached and returns immediately, so short polling calls interleave
with training and each result is copied off the VM as soon as it exists.

Usage: upload the argument vector to ``/content/job_cmd.txt`` (one argument per line, the
first being the script path), then ``colab exec -f launch_detached.py``. Re-running while
the job is alive is a no-op, so a poller may call it defensively.
